Student: Nitzan Cohen\
Date: August 4, 2022

## About the project
I did the project as part of the final project of Practicum's web development course. As part of this project and the course in general, I learned to use a variety of technological tools for website development. Starting with the use of HTML and CSS at the level of designing and building the website, and of course also tools that touch the functionality of the website with the help of JavaScript and React. On the server side, I learned to build a server with Node.js and Express.js. and work with a database using MongoDB.
